    <p>Hello, my name is Carlos De La Cantera. I hold a BAS in Project Management fro Northwest Florida State College.  My most recent job experience is my current occupation.  I currently work at Apple with the most pretentious job title in the world "Genius" I have been with Apple for 6 years and have provided technical support over the phone and in person.  I also do modular repairs on iPhone and all Mac products. Prior to that I worked in the cigar industry for 9 years as a tobacconist.  My goals are to learn how to code so I can advance in my career at Apple or at a different company.  I'm looking for better work life balance and of course more income.</p>
